## Introduction
On 1 January 2019, the Italian government introduced legislation requiring that all invoices issued between parties in Italy must be transmitted exclusively in electronic format through the "*Sistema di Interscambio*" (SDI) of the Italian "*Agenzia delle Entrate*". To simplify this process, several dedicated portals and software can be used, including BIP xTech and TeamSystem. The latter are consistently engaged in the pursuit of novel technologies and methodologies with the objective of optimising the user experience. They espouse a customer-centric approach to innovation, whereby their designers integrate the needs of individuals, technological possibilities and requirements for business success.

It is well established that certain invoice types are not subject to value-added tax and enjoy tax exemptions. The nature of these exemptions is coded using a nature code, which comprises 21 different values. Additionaly, users has to map the nature code to exemption code that represent the reason why the invoice is not subject to VAT. This task is complex and sophisticated due to the presence of 64 exemption codes, which necessitates that a nature code may correspond to more than one IvaM code. 

The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that is capable of predicting and suggesting the VAT exemption code (IvaM) to users based on the data on the invoice. This will enable the process to be streamlined. The following sections will engage in a comprehensive examination of the argument presented in this work.

## Methods
The company provides us with a substantial dataset, comprising approximately 130,000 invoice lines and 45 characteristics for each of them, including very useful informations like ATECO code, document type, invoice type, VAT rate, article description, amount and many more. 

#### Data Cleaning
The first step of our work has been the visualization of missing value:
